For the assessment of the quality of its data, Tonalities adopts a data entry protocol for the constitution of its current corpus of MEI scores, the so-called Tonalities Score Quality Validation Protocol (TSQVP). The following parameters have been systematically verified/harmonised to ensure high quality scores: 

metadata in the header (composer, title, encoder/editor, licence, and genre);
pitches; 
rhythmic values; 
distribution of the lyrics (with a particular attention to the convenable syllabification and to the prosody); 
articulation in sections or internal parts.

TSQVP protocol may be object of minor adaptations and modifications, due to the progressing workflow and to the forthcoming integration of other music repertories.
