For the assessment of the quality of its data, Tonalities adopts a data entry protocol for the constitution of its current corpus of MEI scores, the so-called Tonalities Score Quality Validation Protocol (TSQVP). The following parameters have been systematically verified/harmonised to ensure high quality scores: 

metadata in the header:
   - composer
   - title
   - encoder/editor
   - licence
   - genre
pitches; 
rhythmic values.


The metadata in Tonalities' native MEI fileshave been encoded according to the following tags and labels:

[composer]
<composer xml:id="...">
   <persName role="creator" xml:id="..."></persName>
</composer>

[title]
<titleStmt xml:id="...">
   <title xml:id="..."></title>

[encoder/editor]
<respStmt xml:id="...">
   <persName role="editor" xml:id="..."></persName>
</respStmt>

[licence]
<pubStmt xml:id="...">
   <availability xml:id="...">
      <useRestrict xml:id="..."><useRestrict/>
   </availability>
</pubStmt>

[genre]
<classification>
   <termList>
    <term label="music genre"></term>
   </termList>
</classification>

The encoding process for all these parameters is heterogeneous and depends on the origin of the MEI files (in particular for external datasets) and on the MEI practice adopted by each research team which produced them.
We manage this heterogeneity through a script (https://github.com/polifonia-project/tonalities_pilot/tree/main/scripts/meihead-parser) expressly conceived for injecting them into a homogeneous model (cidoc), on the basis of which we contribute to Polifonia's knowledge graph in music-meta (https://github.com/polifonia-project/music-meta-ontology).

TSQVP protocol may be object of minor adaptations and modifications, due to the progressing workflow and to the forthcoming integration of other music repertories.
