The Tonalities Score Quality Validation Protocol for Zarlino‘s Corpus (TSQVPZC) has been exclusively adopted for a particular group of works, containing all the musical works quoted and modally identified by Zarlino in the fourth book of his musical treatise Le Institutioni harmoniche (Venice, the author, 1558). This specific protocol fixes the following specific parameters: 

pitches; 
rhythmic values; 
distribution of the lyrics (with a particular attention to the convenable syllabification and to the prosody); 
articulation in sections or internal parts.  
the adoption of the clefs of the original source; 
the use of a conversion table between modern time signatures and ones from the Early period,  
the adoption of the integer valor; 
the conversion of the Mensurstrich in normal bar lines. 
 
The attention to the clefs employed in the original source is due to the fact that their position and typology is usually considered a clue-element for the modal attribution of a composition by the music theorists of that period. All the other parameters are fixed in order to provide a standard version of the score to the end users, and to guarantee an uniformised dataset to work on to our IT expert team. 

TSQVPZC protocol can be object of adaptations and modifications, due to the progressing workflow.
